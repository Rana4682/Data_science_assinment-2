# DevelopersHub Corporation – Data Science & AI/ML Engineering Internship

## Internship Overview

This repository contains the solutions to the advanced-level internship tasks assigned by DevelopersHub Corporation as part of the Data Science & AI/ML Engineering Internship (Submission Deadline: 24th July 2025).

These tasks are designed to provide practical experience in solving real-world data science problems, including classification, clustering, time series forecasting, explainable AI (XAI), and business intelligence (BI). The projects demonstrate the use of Python and industry-standard libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, shap, Prophet, and Streamlit.

The goal of this internship is to strengthen applied data science skills, improve project structuring, and showcase the ability to build interpretable, efficient, and production-ready solutions.
